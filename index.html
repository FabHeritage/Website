                    <p>
                        <strong>Desmond Crimson</strong> had a smooth red face and nice gold details, showing high-class
                        style. He enjoyed big parties and dinners with candles, always resting on the wrist of someone
                        who liked his classy look. For him, each tick was like a dance, and every second was a party of
                        luxury.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Dempsey</strong>, nicknamed "The Sporty One," was Desmond’s polar opposite. Designed for
                        adventure, he was rugged, water-resistant, and practically indestructible. Dempsey thrived on
                        the thrill of the race, cheering on his wearer as they conquered marathons, scaled mountains,
                        and swam through roaring waves.

                        <Strong>Arthur the Oldtimer</Strong><small></small>was a relic from another age, his worn
                        leather strap and complex cogs and gears telling tales of countless bygone eras he had lived
                        through, of being worn by scholars and poets and dreamers. His beat was slower, more measured-an
                        admonition to live a moment at a time.
